# nodecart
User-friendly Ecommerce CMS based on Node.js, Koa.js, RESTful API, Bookshelf.js, Handlebars.js, Backbone.js, Marionette.js, Bootstrap, Rendr

## Intro
The future of CMS is repedly moving twards js and we thought it could be a great thing to move our development from php cms to node.js ... so we looked to find a simple yet powerful CMS based on our favorite libraries... we are still looking)

One day we did a small compitition in our small company where we asked every developer to make a small ecommerce site on node.js and MongoDB. We were pleasently surprised with the result. We got several very well structured CMS and so from that moment we decided to start our own small yet interesting project. 

###Philosophy behind the idea
1. Accessible - we wanted the CMS to be as simple as possible for any person to install and start wroking with. We like when its easy.
2. Simplicity - is how we think. Like the first part, we wanted the code to be as simple as possible. The structure as well. Everything has to be understandble, so that the CMS actually didn't need a documentation. It just has to be as simple as possible for anybody to use it and to develop for it.
3. Independent - we want it to be absolutely free. No extra services, not extra api endpoitns - no nothing. everything is in the zip) use it as you like. We would want it this way.
4. Technology - we just decided that we won't use old stuff. We are not saying old ois bad, we just want to try new things and learn more. its more fun. 
5. Extensible - i guess this is a must. it should have the possiblities for other developers to add modules to extend its functionality. themes and extensions and even services. 
6. Updatable - well wouldn't it be great to have a built in update system that work like it supposed to. We would deffinitly want this.
