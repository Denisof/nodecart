# nodecart
User-friendly Ecommerce CMS based on Node.js, Express, RESTful API, MongoDB, Handlebars.js, Backbone.js, Marionette.js, Bootstrap, Rendr

## Intro
The future of CMS is repedly moving twards js and we thought it could be a great thing to move our development from php cms to node.js ... so we looked to find a simple yet powerful CMS based on our favorite libraries... we are still looking)

One day we did a small compitition in our small company where we asked every developer to make a small ecommerce site on node.js and MongoDB. We were pleasently surprised with the result. We got several very well structured CMS and so from that moment we decided to start our own small yet interesting project.
